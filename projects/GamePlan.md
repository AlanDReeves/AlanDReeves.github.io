## Overview
GamePlan is a web app which allows users to reserve court space for either basketball or volleyball at the University of Hawai'i rec center.
The idea was thought up by one of our group members who enjoys playing a the rec center, but often finds it hard to get a chance to play since the courts fill up very fast.
The app has different pages for volleyball and basketball, allows users to sign in, shows what games are reserved, and allows users to track scores for games that are going on today.
We developed GamePlan using Next.js, React, and Node, among other resources.
The project was made for its own sake as an education tool, and so it is not used by the rec center.

## My Contribution
I created several of the pages, including the sign in/sign up/sign out pages and the landing page.
I was also responsible for connecting the front end elements to the database, writing playwright tests for some of the pages, setting up continuous integration, and adding a few sections to the organization page for the project, including the developer guide.
Ultimately I ended up with the majority of the commits in the main repository.
I also ended up in an informal leadership role, organizing group meetings and helping to decide how tasks were split up.

## What I learned
I learned a lot about using Next.js and React, as well as some of the limitations on how Prisma is used. 
A lot of my time was spent researching why certain database calls were not working and I learned how to avoid some of the obvious problems.
I also learned some of what not to do while working on a group project. 
I often took issues myself without thinking to ask anyone else and I ended up putting more of the workload on myself than perhaps I should have.
On the positive side, I also got some exposure to issue driven project management, which is a concept I intend to continue applying in my work.
