Two Dice Pig Game is a simple game which supports two players. The rules for the game are as follows:
Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls two dice until a 1 is rolled or the player decides to “hold”:

If two 1s are rolled, the player’s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.

If a single 1 is rolled, the player scores nothing and the turn ends.

If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player’s turn continues.

If a double is rolled, the point total is added to the turn total as with any roll but the player is obligated to roll again.

If a player chooses to “hold”, their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player’s turn.

The first player to 100 or more points wins.

The beginning pieces of this project were my introduction to computer programming, so I learned many of the basic concepts through this project. I learned such basic concepts as taking user input, generating pseudo-random numbers, and how to use several class files together. In addition to those, I learned how to use some pieces of the Swing framework, which was quite difficult. 

This was one of my earliest projects in computer science and so it is based on an unfinished template created by Professor Cam Moore from UH Manoa. There were no other students involved in this project. This graphical version was a cap stone to the several earlier versions I made in class, which did not all feature a graphical interface.
